# WCS-ToyModelProject
Have a look : 
You can run our streamlit for our presentation here : (https://lthel-wcs-toymodelproject-streamlit-dashboard-kqdgza.streamlit.app/) (I, Louis, was responsible for the Finance part and the HR part)

Context : 
You are commissioned by a company selling models and scale models. 
The company already has a database that lists employees, products, orders, and much more. 
You are invited to browse and discover this database. 
The company database is available on a company server. You can access it in read-only mode.
The company also provides you with the script that you can run on your local MySQL server. The data are identical, and it stops at the end of the previous month.
On the morning of the demo, the data might be refreshed with new and fresh data (and you might receive the update script if you do it locally). The demo should therefore display the latest available data.
The director of the company wishes to have a dashboard which he could refresh each morning to have the latest information in order to manage the company.
The manager does not want to do SQL, he wants to be able to access the data automatically and graphically, if possible through their google account, on the email or Drive. 

Objective :
Your report should revolve around these 4 main topics: sales, finance, logistics, &  HR.
Here are the indicators that should be present in your dashboard but in your advisory role, you are invited to propose additional KPIs and charts.
Visualizations are very much appreciated. 
Sales: 
The number of products sold by category 
The number of products sold by month, 
comparison and rate of change to the same month of the previous year.
Finances: 
The turnover of the orders of the last two months by country. 
Orders that have not yet been paid.
Logistics: 
The stock of the 5 most ordered products.
Human Resources: 
Each month, the 2 sellers with the highest turnover.
